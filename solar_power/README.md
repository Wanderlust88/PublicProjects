# Solar Power Prediction

## Summary

This proof of concept project was developed as part of the Machine Learning Technician 1 at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)
The goal of the project was to develop a model to predict solar power generation through machine learning algorithms using a public
dataset. 

Used Numpy, Pandas, Plotly and scikt-learn to:

* Compile and clean the data
* Feature Engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Development 

Acquired competencies in the following areas:
* Data Engineering
* Modelling
* Business Acumen
