# Dashboard - Bees Data

## Summary

The dashboards presented here were created with Python using the Dash module. Three different configurations were shown to represent the data:

* Using chloropleth maps to represent the US using each state as division
* Using a bar plot to show the percentage incidence in each state
* Using line plots to represent the trends of incidence with time for a given state (coming soon)
